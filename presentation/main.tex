\title{Deep Contact}

% A subtitle is optional and this may be deleted
\subtitle{Accelerating Rigid Simulation with Convolutional Networks}

\author{J.~Wu}
% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different
%   affiliation.

\institute[University of Copenhagen] % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
  Department of Computer Science\\
  University of Copenhagen
}
% - Use the \inst command only if there are several affiliations.
% - Keep it simple, no one is interested in your street address.

\date{Master Thesis Defense, 2018}
% - Either use conference name or its abbreviation.
% - Not really informative to the audience, more for people (including
%   yourself) who are reading the slides online

\subject{Theoretical Computer Science}
% This is only inserted into the PDF information catalog. Can be left
% out. 

% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx
% is a graphic format that can be processed by latex or pdflatex,
% resp., then you can add a logo as follows:

% \pgfdeclareimage[height=0.5cm]{university-logo}{university-logo-filename}
% \logo{\pgfuseimage{university-logo}}

% Delete this, if you do not want the table of contents to pop up at
% the beginning of each subsection:
\AtBeginSubsection[]
{
  \begin{frame}<beamer>{Outline}
    \tableofcontents[currentsection,currentsubsection]
  \end{frame}
}

% Let's get started
\begin{document}

\begin{frame}
  \titlepage
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Outline}
  \tableofcontents
  % You might wish to add the option [pausesections]
\end{frame}

% Section and subsections will appear in the presentation overview
% and table of contents.
\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Previous Work}

\begin{frame}{Previous Work}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    My first point.
  }
  \item {
    My second point.
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Thesis Overview}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Thesis Overview}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Modeling Contact.
    \pause % The slide will pause after showing the first item
  }
  \item {   
    Second item.
  }
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  \item<3-> {
    Third item.
  }
  \item<4-> {
    Fourth item.
  }
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
  \item<5-> {
    Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Particles-Grid-Particles}

\subsection{Grid-Particle Method}
\begin{frame}{Grid-Particle Method}
In order to generate accessible data for CNN model, we transform every state into a set of grid images.
\begin{itemize}
\item {It can make the simulation states be expressed by a set of matrixes, which can be accessible for deep neural networks.
    \pause
}
\item {}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Grid-Particle Method}{Workflow}
The whole workflow can be described as,
\begin{enumerate}
\item {
Based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics(SPH), map current state(\(m, v_x, v_y, \omega, n_x\)) to a image(the number of channel is 5.), which is called feature image.
\pause
}
\item {
The feature image will be used as input to a model(created by a convolutional neural network), then one image(the number of channels is 2) will be getting, which can be called label image.
\pause
}
\item {
For all contacts positions, interpolated values will be gener- ated based on label image. Then, the values will be used as starting iterate values for contact force solver. In our hypoth- esis, the given starting values will speed up the solver to reach convergence.
}

\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title

There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.

Here is an example of an example block.
