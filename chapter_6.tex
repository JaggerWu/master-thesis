\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
Six months ago, I had to formulate a set of goals for the work of this thesis. The goals was thus set before having gained the knowledge I have now. For this reason, the goals reached may appear slightly different from those set. I started out thinking that the Fischer–Newton method might just be a contender to the title state of the art method in interactive contact force determination. Four months and a paper later, I faced the limitations of the Fischer–Newton method. \\

Half one year ago, I had to formulate a set of goals for the work of this thesis. Althogh the goals were set before I gained the current knowledge, I still fortunately acheive almost all goals except respectively training two models for normal and frictional contact forces. To recap on the goals
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Describe the contact model by \textit{Newton-Euler} equation}
    \item \textbf{Analyze SPH kernel}
    \item \textbf{Analyze grid size and smoothing length}
    \item \textbf{CNN design}
    \item \textbf{Comparision among different model solution}
    \item \textbf{Training both normal forces and friction forces}
\end{itemize}
