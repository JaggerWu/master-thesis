\chapter{Rigid Body Dynamics Simulation}

This chapter mainly introduces rigid body simulation to help you understand how computer simulate rigid dynamics based on traditional newton-types methods. For more details, some contact forces solvers are decribed in this chapter. Afterwards, we will use one of solver to run some simulation and get the image data for the next step, grids-transfer.
