\chapter{Introdustion}

\section{Motivation}
    Movies studies have been pushing facial and character animation to a level where machine learning can  automize a large part of this work in a production pipeline. Research community is exploring machine learning for gait control too and quite successfully or for upscaling of liquid simulation\cite{CNNFluid2016}. \\

    However, for rigid body problems it is not quite clear how to approach the technicalities in applying deep learning. Some work have been done in terms of inverse simulations or pilings to control rigid bodies to perform a given artistic `target'. These thechniques are more in spirit of inverse problems that maps initial conditions to a well defined outcome(number of bounces or which face up on a cude) or level of detail idea replacing interiors of piles with stracks of cylinders pf decreasing radius to make an overall apparent pile have a given angle of of repose.

\section{Thesis Overview}

    This thesis explore the application of convolutional neural networks in Computer Simulation.
