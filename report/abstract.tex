    The subject of this thesis is to apply deep learning method in rigid dynamic simulation, specifically for predicting good contact forces. The central concept of this thesis is to convert the simulation state information to accessible data for deep learning model. The basic idea is to use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) based method to transform all essential data to a grid image, then trian a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict a grid image for contact forces. The interpolated values in each contact positon would be used as warm starting for the iterative contact solver.

    The results show that SPH based method is a good strategy to convert the simulation state to a multiple-channels image without losing lots of essential information. Finally, the trained CNN model can actually provide great warm starting values for the contact solver in each step. But because it has to take the longer time on computing interpolation values, the CNN based method is not still very efficient. However, the implementation of CNN experiments shows the potential of applying deep learning in rigid contact solution.
